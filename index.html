                    <h2>Introduction To A Machine Learning Online Course</h2>
                    <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp; | 05 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p> We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.

                    <h2>Importance of Data Backup and Recovery in the IT industry</h2>
                    <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp; | 05 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p>A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order to bring about a positive change in the work environment. One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is necessary for every business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and computers should conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a boon in any point of time.
                   Before moving forward, let us understand the concept of Data Backup and Recovery.
                  Backup is the process of creating and storing copies of data that is confidential to the organization against the data loss or in case of emergency. Recovery is the process that involves restoring the lost data to the original location or another location. It is essential to have a proper backup copy in a separate system.</p>

                    <h2>Impact of Cloud Computing in various industries
</h2>
                    <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp; | 22 July 2019</p>
                    <p>Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud.</p>

                    <p>Introducing web scraping:<br />

Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather and analyze information from the Internet.

Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet.

Rather than reading data from standard API responses, we’ll need to find the data ourselves by reading the website’s pages and feeds.</p>

                    <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp; | 05 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p>As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily, cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies today. The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after adopting every security measure possible by businesses. Cyber attackers are developing advancing technologies that are continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through which a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities, user interaction (using malicious links, email attachments) and use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.Cybersecurity plays an integral role in the process of good business models.
